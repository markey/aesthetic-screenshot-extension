## Technical Details

- **Manifest Version**: 3 (latest Chrome extension standard)
- **Storage**: Uses Chrome's sync storage for cross-device settings
- **Permissions**: Minimal required permissions for functionality
- **Compatibility**: Works with all modern Chrome-based browsers

### Rendering Quality Notes

- Uses Chrome DevTools Emulation to capture at up to 2× device scale while keeping layout stable.
- Preserves the native hi‑res bitmap in the final PNG (no downscale), which keeps text edges sharp.
- Temporarily enforces a system UI font stack and light color scheme during capture to improve hinting and contrast, then reverts the page.
